# Find-finite-difference-coefficients
Find finite difference coefficients for central, backward and forward stencils.

Try it in [replit](https://replit.com/@luisleo526/Find-finite-difference-coefficients?v=1).

## Notes

for forward/backward approximation, the indices should be input like `0,1,2,3` wheras the value indicates the distance to the point for approximation
